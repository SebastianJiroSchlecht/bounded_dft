# Bounded Magnitude DFT
Companying Code to "Bounded Magnitude DFT" to appear in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Tipps and Tricks

The code provides full reproducibility of the paper figures. Two demo files are included
- demo_fullExample.m
- demo_bounds.m

The code has been developed and tested on MATLAB R2022a on MacOSX Monterey.

The link to the paper will be published soon.
